# Challenge 19596: Interviews

**Source:** [View challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/interviews/problem?isFullScreen=true)

## Challenge

Samantha interviews many candidates from different colleges using coding challenges and contests. Write a query to print the _contest\_id_, _hacker\_id_, _name_, and the sums of _total\_submissions_, _total\_accepted\_submissions_, _total\_views_, and _total\_unique\_views_ for each contest sorted by _contest\_id_. Exclude the contest from the result if all four sums are $0$.

**Note:** A specific contest can be used to screen candidates at more than one college, but each college only holds $1$ screening contest.

- _Contests:_ The _contest\_id_ is the id of the contest, _hacker\_id_ is the id of the hacker who created the contest, and _name_ is the name of the hacker.
