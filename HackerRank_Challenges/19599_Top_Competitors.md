# Challenge 19599: Top Competitors

**Source:** [View challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/full-score/problem?isFullScreen=true)

## Challenge

Julia just finished conducting a coding contest, and she needs your help assembling the leaderboard! Write a query to print the respective _hacker\_id_ and _name_ of hackers who achieved full scores for *more than one* challenge. Order your output in descending order by the total number of challenges in which the hacker earned a full score. If more than one hacker received full scores in same number of challenges, then sort them by ascending _hacker\_id_.

## SQL Solution

~~~sql
SELECT
    h.hacker_id,
    h.name
FROM hackers h
LEFT JOIN submissions s ON s.hacker_id = h.hacker_id
LEFT JOIN challenges c ON c.challenge_id = s.challenge_id
LEFT JOIN difficulty d ON d.difficulty_level = c.difficulty_level
WHERE s.score = d.score
GROUP BY h.hacker_id, h.name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT c.challenge_id) > 1
ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT c.challenge_id) DESC, h.hacker_id;
