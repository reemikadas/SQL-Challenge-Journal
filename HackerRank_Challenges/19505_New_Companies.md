Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the _company\_code_, _founder_ name, total number of _lead_ managers, total number of _senior_ managers, total number of _managers_, and total number of _employees_. Order your output by ascending _company\_code_.

**Note:**

- The tables may contain duplicate records.
- The _company\_code_ is string, so the sorting should not be **numeric**. For example, if the _company\_codes_ are _C\_1_, _C\_2_, and _C\_10_, then the ascending _company\_codes_ will be _C\_1_, _C\_10_, and _C\_2_.
