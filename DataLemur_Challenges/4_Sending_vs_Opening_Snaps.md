# DataLemur Challenge 4: Sending vs. Opening Snaps

**Source:** [View challenge](https://datalemur.com/questions/time-spent-snaps)

## Challenge

This is the same question as problem #25 in the SQL Chapter of [Ace the Data Science Interview](https://amzn.to/3kF79Fx)!

Assume you're given tables with information on Snapchat users, including their ages and time spent sending and opening snaps. 

Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps as a percentage of total time spent on these activities grouped by age group. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places in the output.

Notes:
- Calculate the following percentages:
  - time spent sending / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
  - Time spent opening / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
- To avoid integer division in percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100.

### `activities` Table
|Column Name|Type|
|:----|:----|
|activity_id|integer|
|user_id|integer|
|activity_type|string ('send', 'open', 'chat')|
|time_spent|float|
|activity_date|datetime|

### `activities` Example Input
|activity_id|user_id|activity_type|time_spent|activity_date|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|7274|123|open| 4.50 |06/22/2022 12:00:00|
|2425|123|send| 3.50 |06/22/2022 12:00:00|
|1413|456|send| 5.67 |06/23/2022 12:00:00|
|1414|789|chat| 11.00 |06/25/2022 12:00:00|
|2536|456|open| 3.00 |06/25/2022 12:00:00|

### `age_breakdown` Table
|Column Name|Type|
|:----|:----|
|user_id|integer|
|age_bucket|string ('21-25', '26-30', '31-25')|

### `age_breakdown` Example Input
|user_id|age_bucket|
|:----|:----|
|123|31-35|
|456|26-30|
|789|21-25|

### Example Output
|age_bucket|send_perc|open_perc|
|:----|:----|:----|
|26-30|65.40|34.60|
|31-35|43.75|56.25|

### Explanation
Using the age bucket 26-30 as example, the time spent sending snaps was 5.67 and the time spent opening snaps was 3. 

To calculate the percentage of time spent sending snaps, we divide the time spent sending snaps by the total time spent on sending and opening snaps, which is 5.67 + 3 = 8.67. 

So, the percentage of time spent sending snaps is 5.67 / (5.67 + 3) = 65.4%, and the percentage of time spent opening snaps is 3 / (5.67 + 3) = 34.6%.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - **this is just an example**!

## SQL Solution

~~~sql
WITH time_spent_table AS (
  SELECT
    ab.age_bucket,
    SUM(CASE WHEN a.activity_type = 'open' THEN a.time_spent END) AS time_spent_opening,
    SUM(CASE WHEN a.activity_type = 'send' THEN a.time_spent END) AS time_spent_sending
  FROM activities a
  INNER JOIN age_breakdown ab ON ab.user_id = a.user_id
  GROUP BY ab.age_bucket
)
SELECT
  age_bucket,
  ROUND(100.0 * time_spent_sending / (time_spent_sending + time_spent_opening), 2) AS send_perc,
  ROUND(100.0 * time_spent_opening / (time_spent_sending + time_spent_opening), 2) AS open_perc
FROM time_spent_table
;
