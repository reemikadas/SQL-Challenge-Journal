The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - **this is just an example**!

## SQL Solution

~~~sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  DATEDIFF(MAX(post_date), MIN(post_date)) AS days_between
FROM posts
WHERE YEAR(post_date) = '2021'
AND user_id IN (
                  SELECT user_id FROM posts
                  WHERE YEAR(post_date) = '2021'
                  GROUP BY user_id
                  HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
                )
GROUP BY user_id
;
