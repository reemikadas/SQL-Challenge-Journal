# DataLemur Challenge 66: Final Account Balance

**Source:** [View challenge](https://datalemur.com/questions/final-account-balance)

## Challenge

Given a table containing information about bank deposits and withdrawals made using Paypal, write a query to retrieve the final account balance for each account, taking into account all the transactions recorded in the table with the assumption that there are no missing transactions.

### `transactions` Table:
|**Column Name**|**Type**|
|:----|:----|
|transaction_id|integer|
|account_id|integer|
|amount|decimal|
|transaction_type|varchar|

### `transactions` Example Input:
|**transaction_id**|**account_id**|**amount**|**transaction_type**|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|123 | 101  | 10.00 |Deposit|
|124 | 101  | 20.00 |Deposit|
|125 | 101  | 5.00 |Withdrawal|
|126 | 201  | 20.00 |Deposit|
|128 | 201  | 10.00|Withdrawal|

### Example Output:
|**account_id**|**final_balance**|
|:----|:----|
|101 | 25.00 |
|201 | 10.00 |

Using account ID 101 as an example, \$30.00 was deposited into this account, while \$5.00 was withdrawn. Therefore, the final account balance can be calculated as the difference between the total deposits and withdrawals which is \$30.00 - \$5.00, resulting in a final balance of \$25.00.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

## SQL Solution

~~~sql
SELECT
  account_id,
  (SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'Deposit' THEN amount END) -
  SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'Withdrawal' THEN amount END)) AS final_balance 
FROM transactions
GROUP BY account_id
;
~~~
