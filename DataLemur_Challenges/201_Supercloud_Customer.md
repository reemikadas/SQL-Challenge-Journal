# DataLemur Challenge 201: Supercloud Customer

**Source:** [View challenge](https://datalemur.com/questions/supercloud-customer)

## Challenge

A Microsoft Azure Supercloud customer is defined as a customer who has purchased at least one product from every product category listed in the `products` table.

Write a query that identifies the customer IDs of these Supercloud customers.
 
### `customer_contracts` Table:
|Column Name|Type|
|:----|:----|
|customer_id|integer|
|product_id|integer|
|amount|integer|

### `customer_contracts` Example Input:
|customer_id  | product_id  | amount|
|:----|:----|:----|
|1 | 1 | 1000|
|1 | 3 | 2000|
|1 | 5 | 1500|
|2 | 2 | 3000|
|2 | 6 | 2000|

### `products` Table:
|Column Name|Type|
|:----|:----|
|product_id |integer|
|product_category |string|
|product_name|string|

### `products` Example Input:
|product_id|product_category|product_name|
|:----|:----|:----|
|1 | Analytics | Azure Databricks|
|2 | Analytics | Azure Stream Analytics|
|4 | Containers | Azure Kubernetes Service|
|5 | Containers | Azure Service Fabric|
|6 | Compute | Virtual Machines|
|7 | Compute | Azure Functions|

### Example Output:
|customer_id | 
|:----|
|1|

### Explanation:
Customer 1 bought from Analytics, Containers, and Compute categories of Azure, and thus is a Supercloud customer. Customer 2 isn't a Supercloud customer, since they don't buy any container services from Azure. 

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - **this is just an example**!

## SQL Solution

~~~sql
SELECT
  cc.customer_id
FROM customer_contracts cc
INNER JOIN products p ON p.product_id = cc.product_id
GROUP BY cc.customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT p.product_category) = (
                            SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_category)
                            FROM products)
ORDER BY cc.customer_id
;
