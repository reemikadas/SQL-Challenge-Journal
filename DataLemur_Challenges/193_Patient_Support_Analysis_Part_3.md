# DataLemur Challenge 193: Patient Support Analysis (Part 3)

**Source:** [View challenge](https://datalemur.com/questions/patient-call-history)

## Challenge

UnitedHealth Group (UHG) has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows policy holders (or, members) to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs – whether that's claims and benefits support, drug coverage, pre- and post-authorisation, medical records, emergency assistance, or member portal services.

Write a query to obtain the number of unique callers who made calls within a 7-day interval of their previous calls. If a caller made more than two calls within the 7-day period, count them only once.

### `callers` Table:
|**Column Name**|**Type**|
|:----|:----|
|policy_holder_id|integer|
|case_id|varchar|
|call_category|varchar|
|call_date|timestamp|
|call_duration_secs|integer|

### `callers` Example Input:
|policy_holder_id|case_id|call_category|call_date|call_duration_secs|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|13|894a08c6-82c6-49ed-84a0-b627752cdca7|benefits|01/11/2023 02:09:23|794|

### Example Output:
|**policy_holder_count**|
|:----|
|2|

### Explanation:
Policy holder IDs 14 and 15 each made two calls within a 7-day interval. For example, ID 14 made calls on 02/17/2023 and 02/21/2023, and ID 14 on 01/08/2023 and 01/09/2023 consecutively. Hence, the count of unique callers is two.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - **this is just an example**!

## SQL Solution

~~~sql
WITH seven_day_interval AS (
  SELECT
    policy_holder_id,
    call_date AS current_call_date,
    LAG(call_date)
      OVER(PARTITION BY policy_holder_id
          ORDER BY call_date) AS previous_call_date
  FROM callers
)
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT policy_holder_id) AS policy_holder_count
FROM seven_day_interval
WHERE current_call_date - previous_call_date <= INTERVAL '7 days'
;
~~~
