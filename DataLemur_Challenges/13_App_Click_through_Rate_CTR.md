# DataLemur Challenge 13: App Click-through Rate (CTR)

**Source:** [View challenge](https://datalemur.com/questions/click-through-rate)

## Challenge

This is the same question as problem #1 in the SQL Chapter of [Ace the Data Science Interview](https://amzn.to/3kF79Fx)!

Assume you have an events table on Facebook app analytics. Write a query to calculate the click-through rate (CTR) for the app in 2022 and round the results to 2 decimal places.

Definition and note:
- Percentage of click-through rate (CTR) = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
- To avoid integer division, multiply the CTR by 100.0, not 100.

### `events` Table:
|Column Name|Type|
|:----|:----|
|app_id|integer|
|event_type|string|
|timestamp|datetime|

### `events` Example Input: 
|app_id|event_type|timestamp|
|:----|:----|:----|
|123|impression|07/18/2022 11:36:12|
|123|impression|07/18/2022 11:37:12|
|123|click|07/18/2022 11:37:42|
|234|impression|07/18/2022 14:15:12|
|234|click|07/18/2022 14:16:12|

### Example Output: 
|app_id|ctr|
|:----|:----|
|123|50.00|
|234|100.00|

### Explanation
Let's consider an example of App 123. This app has a click-through rate (CTR) of 50.00% because out of the 2 impressions it received, it got 1 click. 

To calculate the CTR, we divide the number of clicks by the number of impressions, and then multiply the result by 100.0 to express it as a percentage. In this case, 1 divided by 2 equals 0.5, and when multiplied by 100.0, it becomes 50.00%. So, the CTR of App 123 is 50.00%.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - **this is just an example**!

## SQL Solution

~~~sql
SELECT
  app_id,
  ROUND((100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN app_id END) / 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN app_id END)),
  2) AS ctr
FROM events
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM timestamp) = '2022'
GROUP BY app_id
;
