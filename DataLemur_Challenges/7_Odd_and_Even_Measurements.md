# DataLemur Challenge 7: Odd and Even Measurements

**Source:** [View challenge](https://datalemur.com/questions/odd-even-measurements)

## Challenge

This is the same question as problem #28 in the SQL Chapter of [Ace the Data Science Interview](https://amzn.to/3kF79Fx)!

Assume you're given a table with measurement values obtained from a Google sensor over multiple days with measurements taken multiple times within each day. 

Write a query to calculate the sum of odd-numbered and even-numbered measurements separately for a particular day and display the results in two different columns. Refer to the Example Output below for the desired format.

Definition:
- Within a day, measurements taken at 1st, 3rd, and 5th times are considered odd-numbered measurements, and measurements taken at 2nd, 4th, and 6th times are considered even-numbered measurements.

*Effective April 15th, 2023, the question and solution for this question have been revised.*

### `measurements` Table:
|Column Name|Type|
|:----|:----|
|measurement_id|integer|
|measurement_value|decimal|
|measurement_time|datetime|

### `measurements` Example Input:
|measurement_id|measurement_value|measurement_time|
|:----|:----|:----|
|131233|1109.51|07/10/2022 09:00:00|
|135211|1662.74|07/10/2022 11:00:00|
|523542|1246.24|07/10/2022 13:15:00|
|143562|1124.50|07/11/2022 15:00:00|
|346462|1234.14|07/11/2022 16:45:00|

### Example Output:
|measurement_day|odd_sum|even_sum|
|:----|:----|:----|
|07/10/2022 00:00:00|2355.75|1662.74|
|07/11/2022 00:00:00|1124.50|1234.14|

###  Explanation
Based on the results, 
- On 07/10/2022, the sum of the odd-numbered measurements is 2355.75, while the sum of the even-numbered measurements is 1662.74.
- On 07/11/2022, there are only two measurements available. The sum of the odd-numbered measurements is 1124.50, and the sum of the even-numbered measurements is 1234.14.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - **this is just an example**!

## SQL Solution

~~~sql
WITH odd_even_sum AS (
    SELECT *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY measurement_time::DATE
                      ORDER BY measurement_time::TIME) AS rn
    FROM measurements
)
SELECT
  measurement_time::DATE AS measurement_day,
  SUM(CASE WHEN rn % 2 <> 0 THEN measurement_value END) AS odd_sum,
  SUM(CASE WHEN rn % 2 = 0 THEN measurement_value END) AS even_sum
FROM odd_even_sum
GROUP BY measurement_time::DATE
ORDER BY measurement_time::DATE
;
