**Source:** [View challenge](https://datalemur.com/questions/international-call-percentage)

## Challenge

A phone call is considered an international call when the person calling is in a different country than the person receiving the call.

What percentage of phone calls are international? Round the result to 1 decimal. 

Assumption:
- The `caller_id` in `phone_info` table refers to both the caller and receiver.
 
### `phone_calls` Table:
|Column Name|Type|
|:----|:----|
|caller_id|integer|
|receiver_id|integer|
|call_time|timestamp|

### `phone_calls` Example Input:
|caller_id | receiver_id | call_time|
|:----|:----|:----|
|1 | 2 | 2022-07-04 10:13:49|
|1 | 5 | 2022-08-21 23:54:56|
|5 | 1 | 2022-05-13 17:24:06|
|5 | 6 | 2022-03-18 12:11:49|

### `phone_info` Table:
|Column Name|Type|
|:----|:----|
|caller_id|integer|
|country_id|integer|
|network|integer|
|phone_number|string|

### `phone_info` Example Input:
|caller_id | country_id | network | phone_number|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|1 | US | Verizon | +1-212-897-1964|
|2 | US | Verizon | +1-703-346-9529|
|3 | US | Verizon | +1-650-828-4774|
|4 | US | Verizon | +1-415-224-6663|
|5 | IN | Vodafone | +91 7503-907302|
|6 | IN | Vodafone | +91 2287-664895|

### Example Output:
|international_calls_pct | 
|:----|
|50.0 |

### Explanation
There is a total of 4 calls with 2 of them being international calls (from caller_id 1 => receiver_id 5, and caller_id 5 => receiver_id 1). Thus, 2/4 = 50.0%

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - **this is just an example**!

## SQL Solution

~~~sql
WITH international_call_table AS (
  SELECT
    pi1.caller_id,
    pi1.country_id AS caller_country_id,
    pi2.caller_id AS receiver_id,
    pi2.country_id AS receiver_country_id
  FROM phone_calls pc
  LEFT JOIN phone_info pi1 ON pi1.caller_id = pc.caller_id 
  LEFT JOIN phone_info pi2 ON pi2.caller_id = pc.receiver_id
  WHERE pi1.country_id <> pi2.country_id
)
SELECT
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM phone_calls),
  1) AS international_calls_pct
FROM international_call_table
;
